Thathanka General Private License (TGPL)

## Introduction

Ever needed a quick broilerplate non-free, restrictive software license? In the F/OSS world there are numerous to choose from (see below for resources) but for private licensing there is no standard approch. Many ad-hoc approaches use some widely disseminated and Adobe sourced broilerplate and this library is no exception.
